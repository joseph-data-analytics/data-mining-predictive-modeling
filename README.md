# Data Mining & Predictive Modeling

This project is based on coursework from **MSIS 672 – Data Mining** at the University of Massachusetts Boston.

## 📌 Objective

Apply data mining techniques to real-world datasets using:

- Classification
- Clustering
- Association rule mining
- Feature engineering
- Model evaluation

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## ✅ Methods

- Supervised learning (classification, regression)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection and transformation
- Train/test split, model evaluation

## 📂 Repository Structure (planned)

- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling  
- `data/` – Sample or synthetic datasets (no private data)  
- `models/` – Saved model artifacts (if applicable)  
- `reports/` – Summary of results and findings  

## 🔍 Key Skills

Python, Data Mining, Machine Learning (basic), Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation
