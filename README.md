# Data Mining & Predictive Modeling

This project is based on coursework from **MSIS 672 – Data Mining** at the University of Massachusetts Boston.

## 📌 Objective

Apply data mining and machine learning techniques to real datasets through:

- Classification
- Clustering
- Predictive modeling
- Feature engineering
- Model evaluation

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📂 Planned Repository Structure

- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling  
- `data/` – Sample datasets (synthetic or publicly allowed)  
- `models/` – Saved model files (optional)  
- `reports/` – Summary of project findings  

## 🔍 Key Skills

Python, Data Mining, Predictive Modeling, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation
